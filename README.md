# Rivers (Arctic hydrology)

We provide a classification algorithm for ice surface features from high-resolution imagery.  This algorithm was developed by convolutional neural network training to detect regions of large and small rivers and to distinguish them from crevasses and non-channelized slush. We also provide a detection algorithm to extract polyline water features from the classified high-probability river areas.
